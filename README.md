# graph-slam-implementation-from-scratch-using-python

 Simulataneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is atechnique used in self-driving cars, robots and other autonomous systems to map the world around them and know their location within this world

 Graph-slam is a method to do this, usiung sensor measurements and robot's actions, a contraint matrix is constructed and a vector, from which the robot states and the locations of the world's landmarks can be calculated
 
 This project simulates a robot in a customizable 2d world, applying this technique from scratch
