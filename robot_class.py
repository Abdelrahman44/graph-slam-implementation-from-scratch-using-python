### Thi is the robot class, which contains robots attributes and methods for navigating and sensing the world, it also generates the world landamrks

class robot:
    
    def __init__(self, world_size=100, sensor_range=100, sensor_noise=2, actuator_noise=2):
        #robot's sensor and actuator are assumed to have noise, which affects the robot's state and measurements
        # the robot is also assumed to be initially at the world's center point
        
        self.world_size = world_size
        self.sensor_range = sensor_range
        self.sensor_noise = sensor_noise
        self.actuator_noise = actuator_noise
        self.x = self.y = self.world_size/2
